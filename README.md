# SENG-265
Assignments from taking a Software Development course!

Assignment #1 was made individually by me!
The rest was collaborated with a partner taking the same course as me

All assignments were based on a theme, and we had to make an interface for a clinic. Each assignment 
was a component for the one after (A3 has parts that will help A4)

Codes were mostly made with Python while Assignment 1 was made with C
